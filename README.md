# Software for Flight Simulator

In this git I will put all the source code of my projects related to flight simulator
and the building of a flight simulator cockpits.

## Altimetro V0.2

This source code is for use with a arduino and my 3D Printed Altimeter (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2744359)
it's conected to FSX via FS2Link.

## autopilot_KAP140  

In a far future will be the arduino code need for by Bendix King KAP140 autopilot, but now it's only the code to
emulate de start-up of the AP as you can see in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJx1XdKjy9c
well model number I'm not sure what is the correct one.


## C182_FS2Link_V0.1
This will be the code for the arduino need to control my panel via FS2LInk.
used a PCA9685 to control 16 servos for gauges
used a 4 digital ouputs and 4 digital inputs for the altimeter gauge
