# Software for FLight Simulator

In this git I will put all the source code of my projects related to flight simulator
and the building of a flight simulator cockpits.

## Altimetro V0.2

This source code is for use with a arduino and my 3D Printed Altimeter (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2744359)
it's conected to FSX via FS2Link.
